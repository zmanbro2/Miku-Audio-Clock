# Miku-Audio-Clock

This is just a simple program that runs in the system tray and has Hatsune Miku say the hour every hour.

decided to put it here so people can use it if they like

I'm very new to programming, so my code might be a bit bad lol.

The program is simple enough that I don't think it matters that much.
