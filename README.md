# Miku-Audio-Clock

This is just a simple program that runs in the system tray and has Hatsune Miku say the hour every hour.

decided to put it here so people can use it if they want to 

I'd recomend having this program start up automatically by pressing
Win + R and typing in "shell:startup" then putting a shortcut of the exe file into the folder
